	To find the answer of how to succeed in crowdfunding, we find many previous works which are mainly focused on to recommend appropriate investors to a project or investigate more influential features on its success. However, in this paper, we would like to suggest a way to set a perfect goal with introducing a regression model. Establishing a goal appropriate is essential for project to success eventually as well as predicting the number of backers a certain Kickstarter project.
	
	Our proposed model show better performance than existing algorithm(Simple linear regression and XgBoost). It returns RMSE(Root Mean Square Error) 23.7 and 1,659, prediction for the number of backer and funding respectively.
