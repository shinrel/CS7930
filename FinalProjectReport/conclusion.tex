\section{Conclusion and Future work}
In this paper, we addressed two problems of predicting how many backers will back for a Kickstarter project and how much funding that the project can receive. For the sake of seeking the answers for these problems, we proposed a non-linear model which made use of linear regression model after doing transformation on response \emph{Y}. We compare our model with linear regression model and extreme boosting model for linear regression (Xgboost) which is a state-of-the art linear model. In our experiment, we have shown that our model is outperformed the rest with lowest RMSE in both two problems: RMSE of 23.7 in predicting how many backers will back for the project and RMSE of 1659 in predicting how much funding the project can receive. Our work provides new insight into crowdfunding campaigns, that help creators set a perfect goal for their projects and increase their successful rate in raising fund.

Our work is still limited into Kickstarter platform only. In the future, we will collect all crowdfunding projects in different platforms and suggest more general features. We also improve the model so that RMSE value can be smaller.
