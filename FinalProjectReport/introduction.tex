\section{Introduction}
Our contributions (or research questions) in this proposal are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Understand the influence of multiple factors toward the number of backers and the amount of final pledged money that a certain project can receive. We will show statistic values to illustrate for such influence.
\item Given a project, we build a model to predict how much pledged fund the creator can receive
\item Building a model to predict how many backers will fund for the project.
\end{itemize}
