\section{Dataset}
Our examined data set contains 151,608 Kickstarter project pages that are collected between 2009 and September 2014. Our another work \cite{chung2015long} also used this data. In 151,608 Kickstarter project pages that we collected, there are 142,890 distinct creators.

In the following sections, we will use all 151,608 Kickstart projects pages to do analysis and to build two models to predict the number of backers who will back for a Kickstarter project as well as the amount of funding that the project can receive.
